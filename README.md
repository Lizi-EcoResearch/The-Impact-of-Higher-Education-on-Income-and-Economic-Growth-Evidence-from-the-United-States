## üìå Abstract

Higher education leads to increased individual income and contributes to national economic growth. Using annual data from 2000 to 2015, this study employs an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to examine how higher education, along with investment, household consumption, government expenditure, and trade openness, affects Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in the U.S.

## üìö Theoretical Framework

This study is based on **human capital theory**, which suggests that investments in education enhance the productivity and earnings potential of individuals, thereby stimulating economic growth.

## üìà Econometric Model

We estimate the following log-linear model using OLS:
ln(GNI) = Œ∏ + Œ¥‚ÇÅ ln(HL) + Œ¥‚ÇÇ ln(INV) + Œ¥‚ÇÉ ln(HC) + Œ¥‚ÇÑ ln(GE) + Œ¥‚ÇÖ ln(OPEN) + Œº


Where:
- **GNI**: Gross National Income per capita (constant 2015 USD)
- **HL**: Labor force with advanced education
- **INV**: Net investment in non-financial assets (% of GDP)
- **HC**: Household final consumption expenditure (constant 2015 USD)
- **GE**: General government final consumption expenditure (constant 2015 USD)
- **OPEN**: Trade openness (% of GDP)

## üß™ Data & Analysis

- **Source**: All data were retrieved from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).
- **Software**: SPSS was used for regression analysis.
- **Sample size**: 16 annual observations (2000‚Äì2015).
- **Results**:
  - R¬≤ = 0.978 ‚Äî model explains 98% of the variation in GNI per capita.
  - Significant variables include **household consumption**, **government expenditure**, and **trade openness**.
  - Surprisingly, **higher education** showed a negative coefficient, prompting deeper discussion in the paper.

## üìå Key Findings

- Higher education plays a significant, though complex, role in influencing economic growth.
- Household consumption and government expenditure have strong positive correlations with GNI per capita.
- Investment in education must be aligned with employability and industry needs to translate into macroeconomic gains.
